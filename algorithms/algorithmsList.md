## Top 10 algorithms for Data Mining

We referred to this [blog](http://blog.csdn.net/leo2007608/article/details/9347863) for listing 10 influential algorithms reported in ICDM 2006.

+ C4.5-which inherits ID3 for building decision trees in classification tasks.
+ K-Means algorithm-one clustering algorithm. (刘畅 2120151011，罗佩 2120151019)
+ Support Vector Machines-Supervised learning methodology used in statistical classification and regression by pursuing maximum distance between super planes.
+ The Apriori algorithm-for mining frequent patterns(frequent itemset mining).
+ Expectation Maximization-to handle latent variables in probabilistic models.
+ PageRank-Larry Page owns this patent, the co-founder of google.
+ AdaBoost-An iterative algorithm for combining weak classifiers  to form a strong one.(崔绿叶)
+ K-Nearest Neighbor-For finding k nearest neighbor of an instance in feature space. (张燕妮2120151065，韩梦乔2120150989)
+ Naive Bayes-Naive but powerful.
+ CART-Classification and Regression Trees.
